# Linux-Environment
A continous work in progress. This is of a collection of scripts and packages that will allow me to quickly set up a prefered linux environment on Kali Linux. I'm writing this to automate my setup process but to also use it as a project to teach myself bash scripting.

## Packages that are currently set to install
* BSPWM Window Manager
* SXHKD for BSPWM
* rtl882au Driver for Alpha
